# Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repo is dedicated to implementing popular machine learning algorithms in Python from scratch and using libraries. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code for each algorithm, making it easy for others to understand and experiment with.

## ðŸ“œ Algorithms Included

1. **Simple Linear Regression**

2. **Decision Tree**
  
3. **Random Forest**

4. **Logistic Regression**

5. **SVM**

> Additional algorithms will be added in the future, including models for classification, clustering, and deep learning.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with these algorithms:-

   -You need to have basic understanding of python.
   
   -You need be aware with python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,... etc.)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khanz9664/Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python
