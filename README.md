# Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repo is dedicated to implementing popular machine learning algorithms in Python from scratch and using libraries. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code for each algorithm, making it easy for others to understand and experiment with.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository currently includes:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: A foundational regression model that fits a straight line through the data points.
- **Decision Tree**: A versatile algorithm for both classification and regression tasks, structured as a tree with decision nodes.

As this project grows, more algorithms will be added, covering various aspects of machine learning.

## ðŸ“œ Algorithms Included

1. **Simple Linear Regression**

2. **Decision Tree**
  
3. **Random Forest**

4. **Logistic Regression**

5. **SVM**

> Additional algorithms will be added in the future, including models for classification, clustering, and deep learning.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with these algorithms:-

   -You need to have basic understanding of python.
   
   -You need be aware with python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,... etc.)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khanz9664/Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Algos-Using-Python
